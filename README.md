- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pear1Grey
- 👀 I’m interested in natural languages: Enlgish and French.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something. At now I want to write a blog about gravel bikes. Do not actually know, what I want to create via Python. But I open for different cooperations.
